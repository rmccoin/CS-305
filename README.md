1.) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a finace company looking to modernize their software so that they can provide their clients with the most current and effective software security.  What Artemis Finiancial expected from Global Rain was to take their existing software application and add secure communication mechanisms that meet the companies requirements. 

2.) What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

What I did for Artemis Financial was identified the softwasre security vulnerabilities and patched them, so that I could provide the companies software with more security.  It is important to code securely because doing so can prevent potential breaches and provides protection to data. Software security provides a company with a peace of mind, knowing their information and data is safe.  It also can provide trust between them and their clients, knowing their data is protected.   

3.) Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part of the vulnerabilty assessment that was challenging was the false positives and negatives.  Determining which were false can take time, because there are so many to sort through.  

4.) How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security I used encryption and implemented multi-factor authentification.  In the future, to assess vulnerabilities and to determine which mitigation techniques to use, I would use vulnerability scanning tools.   

5.) How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To make certain that the code and software application were functional and secure I ran tests and reviewed my code many times.  I also checked for new vulnerabilites by running static code analysis tools. 

6.) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Resources, tools, or coding practices that I uses that might have been helpful in future assignments or tasks were, the use of vulnerability scanning tools and secure coding practices.  Vulnerabilty scanning tools were a new topic for me, that I will make sure to use again in the future.  

7.) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment I would show future employers I could show them the steps I took to secure the code, and the vulnerability assessment report and explain the steps I took, after identifying the vulnerabilities.
